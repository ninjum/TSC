# build-appimage-test.sh - what .github/scripts/build-appimage.sh must and must
# not fail a release for.
#
# The script packs the AppImage and then checks it: it unpacks what it just
# built and runs `tsc --print-paths`, which resolves the game data directory
# exactly as the game does and exits nonzero when the data is not where it will
# look. That check exists because the 2.2.0-beta2 AppImage shipped carrying all
# 240 MB of its data and still aborted on startup with
#
#   CEGUI::FileIOException ... /usr/share/tsc/gui/schemes/TSCLook256.scheme
#   does not exist
#
# A check that runs on every release build has to be careful about WHEN it
# fails. Nothing environmental - a missing unsquashfs, an AppImage that would
# not unpack here - may withhold a finished AppImage; those warn. Only tsc
# saying the data is missing fails the build. This pins both halves, because
# getting it the other way round would either block releases for tooling
# reasons or wave the original bug through.
