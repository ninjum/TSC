# expected-assets.sh <version> - every asset a complete TSC release carries.
#
# Prints one line per PRIMARY asset:
#
#   <kind> <selector> <asset-name> <sums|nosums>
#
# `kind` is the workflow that builds it (deb, appimage, flatpak, windows, mac);
# `selector` is the value that workflow's `only` input filters its matrix on, so
# release-all-missing.yml can say "build these three and nothing else".
#
# The CHECKSUMS are not listed, they are DERIVED. Every one of these workflows
# writes `<asset>.md5sum` and `<asset>.sha256sum` beside the file, KEEPING the
# asset's full name - TSC-2.2.0-beta2-x86_64.AppImage is checksummed as
# TSC-2.2.0-beta2-x86_64.AppImage.md5sum - so `sums` means "and those two as
# well". Keeping the extension is what stops two assets that share a stem (the
# x86_64 AppImage and the x86_64 Flatpak, the win64 .exe and the win64 .7z) from
# writing to the same checksum file and clobbering each other - which is exactly
# why the earlier extension-dropped naming left some assets with no checksum. Such
# an asset counts as present only when all three are there: a package whose
# checksum upload failed is a half-published release, and treating the package
# alone as present would leave it that way.
#
# `nosums` is for the build-script zips, which are published without checksums.
# Requiring them would leave those two permanently "missing".
#
# THE LISTS BELOW MUST MATCH THE WORKFLOWS' MATRICES. Each is named beside it.
# If a distro or an architecture is added there and not here, this will not
# notice it is missing - which is the one way this script can be wrong without
# anything failing.
#
# NOTE on v2.2.0-beta2: its assets were checksummed under the OLD extension-
# dropped naming, so the x86_64 and aarch64 AppImages and the win64 .exe went
# without a checksum of their own - the same-stem Flatpak and .7z overwrote the
# shared checksum file. Re-running "Release all" or "Release all missing" over
# that release with this workflow rebuilds them and writes the per-asset checksum
# files (<asset>.md5sum / <asset>.sha256sum), filling those gaps in.
