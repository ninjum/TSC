# build-appimage.sh - turn a staged TSC into an AppImage, with its checksums.
#
# An AppImage is one file that runs on any Linux distribution without being
# installed, which is the thing a .deb cannot be: a .deb is built against one
# distribution's libraries and only installs there. That is also what decides
# how this is built - on an OLD distribution, with SFML compiled from source.
# glibc is backward compatible but not forward compatible, so an AppImage can
# only run on a system at least as new as the one it was built on; building it
# on Debian bookworm is what lets it run on everything from bookworm onwards,
# and SFML 3 has to come from source there because bookworm ships SFML 2.
#
# The libraries are bundled by linuxdeploy, which reads the ELF headers, copies
# every shared object the binary needs into the AppDir, and writes an AppRun
# that puts them on the search path.
#
# Environment:
#   TSC_VERSION   e.g. 2.2.0-beta2                        (required)
#   TSC_STAGE     the staging directory from build-tsc.sh (default: ./stage)
#   TSC_PREFIX    the prefix it was staged under          (default: /usr)
#   TSC_APPIMAGE_ARCH  x86_64 | aarch64 | armhf  (default: from uname -m)
#   TSC_OUT       where the AppImage is written           (default: ./dist)
#
# Produces, in $TSC_OUT, named the way the .deb assets are named - the game,
# the version, what it runs on - and with the same two checksum files beside it.
# The checksum files KEEP the full asset name and append .md5sum/.sha256sum, so
# the AppImage and the Flatpak of the same architecture (both TSC-<version>-<arch>)
# do not write to the same checksum file and overwrite each other:
#   TSC-<version>-<arch>.AppImage
#   TSC-<version>-<arch>.AppImage.md5sum
#   TSC-<version>-<arch>.AppImage.sha256sum

# linuxdeploy and appimagetool are themselves AppImages, and a type-2 AppImage's
# runtime is a STATIC-PIE binary. On armhf this job runs under qemu-user (the
# x86_64 runner emulates the armhf container), and qemu-user CANNOT load a
# static-PIE executable: running `linuxdeploy-armhf.AppImage` dies with "cannot
# execute binary file: Exec format error" BEFORE it starts - so
# APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN, which the runtime reads only once it is running, can
# never take effect. The fix is to never execute the runtime: unpack the
# appended squashfs (whose inner linuxdeploy/appimagetool is a DYNAMIC binary
# qemu-user can run) and call that directly. It also drops the FUSE dependency
# the old APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN worked around, so it is done for every arch.
